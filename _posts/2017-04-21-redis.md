##### redis-server安装

```shell
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

##### 启动redis服务

```shell
redis-server
```

#### 连接redis服务，类似mysql

```shell
redis-cli -h host -p port -a password
```

#### 基本命令

```shell
SET username Tom
GET username
```

#### PHP连接Redis

假如php没有安装redis扩展，需要先安装。

```shell
sudo apt-get install php5-redis
```
安装后重启web服务器（apache或php-fpm）

测试连接Redis

```php
<?php
	$redis = new Redis();
	$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);
	echo "Redis server is running:" . $redis->ping();
?>
```

#### Redis[数据类型](https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro)

### strings

Binary-safe strings

### lists

[队列]
collections of string elements sorted according to the order of insertion. They are basically linked lists.

### sets

[集合]
collections of unique, unsorted string elements.

### zsets

[有序集合]
similar to Sets but where every string element is associated to a floating number value, called score. The elements are always taken sorted by their score, so unlike Sets it is possible to retrieve a range of elements (for example you may ask: give me the top 10, or the bottom 10).

### hashes

[哈希表]
which are maps composed of fields associated with values. Both the field and the value are strings. This is very similar to Ruby or Python hashes.

### Bit arrays (or simply bitmaps)

 it is possible, using special commands, to handle String values like an array of bits: you can set and clear individual bits, count all the bits set to 1, find the first set or unset bit, and so forth.

### HyperLogLogs

this is a probabilistic data structure which is used in order to estimate the cardinality of a set. Don't be scared, it is simpler than it seems... See later in the HyperLogLog section of this tutorial.
